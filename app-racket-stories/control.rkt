; We are going to store session information (the session token)

; In order to store `authored-seconds&data` we send
; `digest&authored-seconds&data` where digest is a
; cryptographics hash of authored-seconds&data and, very important,
; a secret salt only known to the server(s).
; If using multiple servers, they need to share the secret salt.

; In short: we are not encrypting the data, we are merely
; associating it with a digest, so it can't be altered.

;;; DISPATCH
;;;

; The main entry point to the control is `dispatch`.
; Dispatch is called by the web-server and receives the current request.

; Before anything else, we check whether the request came from
; a user that has an session cookie with a session token.
; If so, we fetch the session from the db (the model checks that
; the sessions hasn't expired). Such a session implies that the
; user is logged-in, so we can set the current-user.

; After setting current-login-status and current-user, we
; continue to `dispatch-on-url` which based on the url
; decides what happens next.
